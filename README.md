Submission for the "Así Vamos" (https://comovamosnl.org/premio-asi-vamos/) Quantitative Research Competition from "Como Vamos Nuevo León A.C. 

Our winning research focused on understanding the policy views and perspectives from different sectors of the third most populated state in Mexico. 

We used a k-means analysis to generate clusters, and separate the population of Nuevo León based on their socioeconomic status on response for different questions made by the annual survey of Como Vamos N.L.

The objective of this project was to create conversation around the lack of political representation and structural violence amongst the lower classes in one of the most important states in Mexico.

The research project was a collaboration between me and my friend, Manuel Enriquez Meza.
